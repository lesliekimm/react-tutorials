- code grows fast, up to thousands of lines
- split codes into multiple files
- each file will implements well defined & isolated part of app
- node.js --> files are called modules
- each module can be implement other modules
- module can define object with methods
- to store JS objects as text (strings), we use JSON which is a format that
  can encode JS objects to strings
	For a JS object like:
	 { name: 'John Smith',
	   number: '604-123-9999'
	 }
	the equivalent JSON string would be:
	 { "name": "John Smith", "number": "604-123-9999" }
- in JSON format, both keys and values are double quoted & the most impt
  difference is that the full JSON is actually a string
- synchronous vs asynchronous functions
	syncrhonous functions must be executed in order
		console.log() is a synchronous function
	asynchronous functions will return control while continuing execution
	of program
		when reading files, you want asynchronous functions
- use jsonfile package to read JSON sting from file & convert to JS object
	the JSON string:
		[ { "name": "John Smith", "number": "604-123-9090" }, { "name": "Bob Leon", "number": "604-555-1212" } ]
	will be read & converted to JS array containing objects:
		[ { name: "John Smith", number: "604-123-9090" },
		  { name: "Bob Leon", number: "604-555-1212" } ]
			name and number keys are not doubled quoted b/c they
			are JS object properties
